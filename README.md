This was created during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis
SETUP: Before we start running our server, let us set up our environment.
1. Run npm i dotenv
2. Run npm i express
3. Run npm i knex
4. Run npm i nodemon
5. Run npm i pg
6. Run npm i bootsrap

RUNNING THE SERVER: 
1. Create a new database titled "formula1".
2. Create a new .env file and fill in the following variables:
DB_USER=yourusername
DB_PW=yourpassword
DB_NAME=formula1
PORT=whateveryouwanttoruniton
CLIENT=pg
3. Run knex migrate:latest
4. Run knex seed:run
5. Finally, run npm run dev and you have your server up and running.
6. Try getting all the F1 teams by running your localhost followed by "/api/teams".
7. Experiment with the other endpoints in the server.js file too :)
